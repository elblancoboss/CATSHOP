# CATSHOP

The CatShop is a simple order/pickup system that was provided with unfinished classes which required some code to be added so that it works properly.

To run the program by Using BlueJ you need to have the "derby.jar" library loaded in BlueJ. instructions on how to do that are included in a text file "ReadMe" inside the "src" directory. 
after getting the Derby library loaded, you can go ahead and run the program in BlueJ by going to Project->Open Project..-> and select the src directory.
to run the program, go to "clients" package and run the "Main" class and it should work.
